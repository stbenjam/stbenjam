Previously I worked on [The Foreman](https://theforeman.org/), [Metal3 ðŸ¤˜](https://metal3.io/), and various other things. I'm also occassionally a TA for [CSCI E-92](https://cscie92.dce.harvard.edu/), [CSCI E-93](https://cscie93.dce.harvard.edu/), and [CSCI E-95](https://cscie95.dce.harvard.edu/).
